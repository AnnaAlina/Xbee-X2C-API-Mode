# Xbee-X2C-API-Mode
This project further exemplifies the utilization of API mode with the Xbee X2C modules. The goal is to use serial communication between an Arduino and the XBee to digitally write a binary number to I/O pins 0 - 3 to the router XBee. Additionally, bonus objectives are to send the binary number to multiple XBees as well as send to individual XBee addresses.
